I agree with the post in its entirety, and I'll add that Discord (because of the whole we-need-to-scale crap) is failing at what it was originally meant for: providing a VoiP/chat platform with screen sharing. I always had countless troubles on all platforms. Plus this thing that people are moving documentation to discord chats is just insane, the epithome of volatility (a chat) used for something that should be kept as static as possible (documentation).
