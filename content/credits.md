This blog was created using the [eleventy-base-blog v8](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) as a starter template, it later evolved and changed SSG to [Zola](https://getzola.org), but the concept is still similar.

## Inspirations and thanks

I took huge inspirations for the style and general philosophy behind this site from [Simone Silvestroni](https://simonesilvestroni.com/) and his [Minutes to Midnight website](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk). My website content looked very similar to some older iteration of his website (this page was almost identical, but I really liked how it was layed out by Simone). In general Simone's blog was an inspiration both for the design of this site and the ideas I will try to uphold while improving my blog.

[Silvia Maggi](https://silviamaggidesign.com/about/), [Aleksandr Hovhannisyan](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/about/), and [Jan Boddez](https://jan.boddez.net/) for some design inspiration and actual content ideas for presentation pages.

As for eleventy itself, [Kevin Powell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g) was probably the most useful thing I had while approaching this SSG for the first time, together with [Jaydan Urwin's Eleventy Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW). Other super helpful examples I had were those gathered from [The 11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev/).

As of March 2024, this blog uses [Zola](https://getzola.org) as SSG, and while the above credits still hold true, it is only fair to add some more:

[David Lapshin](https://daudix.codeberg.page/), creator of the [Duckquill theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/duckquill/). I learned a lot about Zola and web design by looking at the Duckquill (and his personal website) code, I also took inspiration for the post footer (actually most of the code).

[Vincent Prouillet](https://github.com/Keats) (aka Keats) for creating Zola and for the [Even theme](https://getzola.github.io/even), which inspired the taxonomies single page template and style. 

[Marco Neumann](https://crepererum.net/) for this [image shortcode](https://gitlab.com/crepererum/blog/-/blob/master/templates/shortcodes/image.html?ref_type=heads) that I adapted to my needs (you can see it in [the forgejo repo](https://archaeo.cc/forgejo/andreatitolo/personal_blog_zola/src/branch/main/templates/shortcodes/image.html)).
