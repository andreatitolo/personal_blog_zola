## Inspirations and thanks

I took huge inspirations for the style and general philosophy behind this site from [Simone Silvestroni](https://simonesilvestroni.com/) and his [Minutes to Midnight website](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk). If you go to the latter you will see many similarities indeed (this page is almost identical, but I really liked how it was layed out by Simone). In general Simone's blog was an inspiration both for the design of this site and the ideas I will try to uphold while improving my blog.

[Silvia Maggi](https://silviamaggidesign.com/about/), [Aleksandr Hovhannisyan](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/about/), and [Jan Boddez](https://jan.boddez.net/) for some design inspiration and actual content ideas for presentation pages.

As for eleventy itself, [Kevin Powell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g) was probably the most useful thing I had while approaching this SSG for the first time, together with [Jaydan Urwin's Eleventy Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW). Other super helpful examples I had were those gathered from [The 11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev/).
