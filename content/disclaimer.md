This is a personal website, all opinions are my own.

Most of the things I post about it here are drawn from my own experience, and work for me at the time of writing. I will change my mind and opinion about stuff, sometimes frequently, sometimes not, which I believe is a healthy way of approaching things in life. 

I will try and keep my post as updated as possible, but some of them will reflect my opinions at the time, and should thus be considered a snapshot of my brain at that precise moment.
