This is a list of links to other blogs I find interesting to read or to follow, or blogs for which I appreciate the design. For now the list is just alphabetical, but when I'll find the will to do it I'll add some sort of categorization.

**Note**: following [this suggestion](https://starbreaker.org/links/) no crawlers are allowed on this page, in order to respect any original choice made by each author (this is implemented through a robots.txt file).
