Hi! this is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Living

I'm currently living in Turin, Italy.

## Reading

Recently I am rarely reading one book at the time. 
However, I am currently reading (actively): 

- [Murtagh](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL47319456M/Murtagh) 
- [Cronofagia](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL51160355M/Cronofagia).

## Playing

As with books, I rarely play only one videogame at the time. 
Currently I am playing:
- [Baldurs Gate 3](https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=69037) - on hold
- [Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch](https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=66426) (this is a completely new genre for me)
- [Stardew Valley](https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=35320)

## Watching

- [The Rookie](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79744-the-rookie)
- [Shogun](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/126308-shogun)
- [Bad Batch](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/105971-star-wars-the-bad-batch)

## Learning

Diving deeper into [kart](https://kartproject.org/) and git for an upcoming paper I am writing (and maybe a couple of blog posts here). Alongside this, deepening understanding of [Quarto Manuscripts](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/).

## Work

Currently at the University of Turin as Post-doctoral research associate.
