This page is a list of things I implemented or I want to implement in the future. It is based on [Bacardi55's post](https://bacardi55.io/2024/02/27/ideas-for-my-blog/) and other pages listed there, but mainly [Capjamesg's 100 things you can do on your personal website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/). I usually have a non-versioned `TODO.md` in the root folder of my vscodium project, but I think this can be a nice way of remembering long-term things too.

# To be implemented at some point

- [ ] 88x31 Buttons
- [ ] Changelog page (this would make sense only if showed on the homepage somehow)
- [ ] More webrings
- [ ] Join the indieweb
- [ ] Webmentions (not hosted on the site tough)
- [ ] Indieweb.txt
- [ ] Add "not by AI" button

# Maybe

- [ ] Guestbook (External, not hosted on this site)
- [ ] Add some sort of videogames backlog and read books?
- [ ] Notes? (Microblogging might be better for this)
- [ ] Categories
- [ ] New layout? Holy grail-like?
- [ ] Change-log (makes sense only if shown on the frontpage, otherwise the forgejo repo does the job)
- [ ] Search (only without javascript, maybe with DuckDuckGo? anyway there is not much here to justify the effort in a search)

# Will not do

- [ ] Analytics (I really don't care)
- [ ] Statistics (I really don't care)
- [ ] Donations (this is not a commercial venture)
- [ ] Comments (too much effort, probably require javascript, use the email)
