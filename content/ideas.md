This page is a list of things I implemented or I want to implement in the future. It is based on [Bacardi55's post](https://bacardi55.io/2024/02/27/ideas-for-my-blog/) and other pages listed there, but mainly [Capjamesg's 100 things you can do on your personal website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/). I usually have a non-versioned `TODO.md` in the root folder of my vscodium project, but I think this can be a nice way of remembering long-term things too.

- 88x31 Buttons
- More webrings
- Join the indieweb
- Webmentions (not hosted on the site tough)
- Indieweb.txt
- Add "not by AI" button
- Style the feed with the same color palette as the website

- Guestbook (External, not hosted on this site)
- Personal manifesto (this is something I really want to do, I just need to find the time to sit and avoid venting only)
- Categories
- Breadcrumbs (not really sure how much useful it can be)
- New layout? Holy grail-like?
- Changelog (makes sense only if shown on the frontpage, otherwise the forgejo repo does the job)
- Add some sort of videogames backlog and read books?
- Notes? (Microblogging might be better for this)
- Search (only without javascript, maybe with DuckDuckGo? anyway there is not much here to justify the effort in a search)

- Analytics (I really don't care)
- Statistics (I really don't care)
- Donations (this is not a commercial venture)
- Comments (too much effort, probably require javascript, use the email)
