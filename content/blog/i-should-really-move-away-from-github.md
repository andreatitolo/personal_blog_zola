I have known that Github is not a good place for FOSS community for a while. Github is owned by Microsoft which has always been the evil incarnate and the epitome of the monopolistic corporation, although they managed to gaslight most people opinion in some ways, and they are somehow considered good guys (especially in the gaming community). If you need other reasons to read why "github bad", take a look at the [Give Up Github page (Software Freedom Conservancy)](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) or at the [Nogithub page](https://nogithub.codeberg.page). While I don't consider myself an active part of the FOSS community but just a simple user, I still think we should do something about it. Alternatives are available, being either [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/), [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/), or others.

I am planning to move away from Github for most of my personal stuff. I already have a [Codeberg account](https://codeberg.org/titoloandrea), and I am exploring [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~andreatitolo/), which I quite like for now. My plan is to move the stuff for which I don't expect collaborations to SourceHut, while other repos for collaboration will move to Codeberg, since the Pull Request collaboration format there is more familiar to me and other people too.

Unfortunately, I don't expect my academic stuff (at least the one I am not using alone) to be moved from Github anytime soon. For once I cannot force other people to move away, and some of these repos were linked in published papers, so changing link might not be a good option. Still, any future academic endeavor (like the publishing of my PhD thesis) will be on Codeberg whenever I can.
