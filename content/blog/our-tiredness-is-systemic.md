Academia is plagued by overwork, we all know this. In order to "stay in the game", starting from a PhD we overwork ourselves to burnout and beyond. Academic projects, duties, papers, deadlines loom over us constant, and it's almost impossible to set boundaries for a healthy work-life balance (if there really is any, btw?). 

I will not talk about why people leave academia, as overwork is only one of the many reasons why people become disillusioned with the environment and their job. I will also temporarily gloss over toxic power-relations that halt any healthy change in academia.

Usually, PhD, postdoc, and Early Career Researchers, especially in recent years, are the most affected by this. What really bothers me is that, when we complain, when we say that there is something wrong with what led us to burnout, we are either told that this is the way things are (even arrogantly so), or we are sugarcoated with half-solution that do not address the REAL problem. I will skip the first one as I believe perpetuating the logic of academic elitism and survival culture is a horrible practice that does not even warrant a discussion.

The sugarcoating is what is really infuriating. We are told to stick our head in the sand, that after it will be better (usually meaning: you will be in a position of power where you will be able to make other people miserable), or to let our "creative" side out some times, or to just get trough with your will.

Don't get me wrong, all these suggestions, except the first one, are good and true. Talking with specialists, talk with other colleagues that **for sure** share our same feelings, get off the work for some time. They all help in a useful way.
However, they all fail to recognize one thing or they don't highlight it enough:

**Our tiredness comes from the system, not from us.**

Failing to recognize this means failing to recognize that the current academic system is broken. We need to change the system, and stop accepting things as they are. We need to get in touch with our peers, organize, and demand change. The current system thrives when we are divided, when we work a corridor distance from other colleagues, but we don't know anything about each other.

Once, my best friend, who doesn't work in academia, told me something that has been stuck in my head since. He was referring to his job, but it can be applied to academic jobs as well (especially humanities): **we are not saving lives**.

We are not saving lives, enjoy some rest and f*** work for the amount of time you need to recover. You are not alone, and let our voice be heard.
