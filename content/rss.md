You can use any feed reader you want, if you don't know where to start you can look at the [IndieWeb Camp website](https://indieweb.org/feed_reader) for guidance. Please avoid using and supporting Feedly and its [bloatware design](https://erikgahner.dk/2022/goodbye-feedly/) and [anti-workers](https://web.archive.org/web/20230329162149/https://blog.feedly.com/how-to-track-protests-in-your-market-with-feedly-ai/) [behaviour](https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/feedly-launches-strikebreaking-as).

There are three different RSS feed available on this blog (all of them are also exposed in the site `<head>`):
- [Feed for everything](/atom.xml) (blog, bookmarks).
- Feed for [blog posts only](/blog/atom.xml).
- Feed for [bookmarks only]((/bookmarks/atom.xml)).

All feeds follow the [Atom standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)?lang=en&lang=simple), so you'll get the whole content of each post without needing to make additional requests or to open the website.
